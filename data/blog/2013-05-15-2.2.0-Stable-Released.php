<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.2.0! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
            <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is the first <em>stable</em> release in the 2.2 series.

<h2>Usability and Consistency</h2>

<p>
    The primary focus of the 2.2 release has been usability and consistency, 
    primarily with regard to creation and configuration of services such as 
    hydrators, input filters, logs, DB connections, cache objects, translators, 
    and forms.
</p>

<p>
    Most of these services now have what are known as "Abstract Factories" that
    are either registered by default, or can be added quickly to your 
    application configuration. Abstract factories are used by the service
    manager when you have multiple services that follow the same instantiation
    pattern, but which have different names. The typical pattern the new 
    abstract factories follow is to use key/configuration pairs under a common
    top-level configuration key to describe the instances desired:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
EOC;
$extended .= highlight_string("<" . "?php
'log' => array(
    'Application\Log' => array(
        'writers' => array(
            array(
                'name'     => 'stream',
                'priority' => 1000,
                'options'  => array(
                    'stream' => 'data/logs/app.log',
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ),
),
", true);
$extended.=<<<'EOC'
</pre>

<p>
    The above creates a logger named "Application\Log" which you can retrieve 
    directly from the service manager. If you wanted to have additional loggers,
    you could do so by adding additional entries under the "log" heading, each
    named, and each providing configuration for a logger.
</p>

<p>
    Besides the logger abstract factory illustrated above, the following 
    components each have abstract factories now, too, using the configuration 
    keys noted:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Zend\Cache</code>: "caches" configuration section, allowing multiple
        named cache storage objects.
    </li>

    <li><code>Zend\Db</code>: "adapters" subkey of the "db" configuration section;
        this abstract factory allows you to finally have multiple named DB adapter
        instances, effectively allowing for read-only and write-only connections.
    </li>

    <li><code>Zend\Form</code>: "forms" configuration section (which makes use 
        of several old and new plugin managers, as noted below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    A number of new plugin managers were also added. Plugin managers are 
    specialized service manager instances used by objects that will be consuming
    many different related object instances, often based on runtime conditions.
    As examples, view helpers and controller plugins are mediated by plugin
    managers.
</p>

<p>
    The new plugin manager instances include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\HydratorPluginManager</code>, for retrieving hydrator
        instances. This allows re-use of individual hydrators, and coupled with the 
        forms abstract factory, allows usage of custom hydrators across your form 
        instances.
    </li>

    <li><code>Zend\InputFilter\InputFilterPluginManager</code>, for retrieving
        (configurable) input filter instances. This allows re-use of input filters, as
        well as ensures that all input instances are provided with custom validators
        and/or filters (from the existing validator and filter plugin managers). The
        forms abstract factory makes use of this, which allows us to finally tie 
        together the various plugin managers to create fully configurable and custom
        forms.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Finally, a couple new service factories were created. Service factories 
    usually have a 1:1 relationship between the named service and the instance
    provided, and are ideal for situations where you only need one instance of
    a given service type. In the case of the new factories for 2.2, these include
    <em>translators</em> and <em>sessions</em>.
</p>

<h2>Data Definition Language Abstraction</h2>

<p>
    Zend Framework 2.2 also offers initial support in <code>Zend\Db</code> 
    for dynamic DDL queries.  DDL, for Data Definition Language, is a subset of 
    SQL that comprises different commands for building RDBMS data 
    structures like tables, columns, constraints, indexes, views, triggers 
    and the like.
</p>

<p>
    Initial support is limited to creating tables with SQL92 data-types, and 
    some specialization for MySQL support.  Here is an example of <code>CREATE 
    TABLE</code> statement:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
EOC;
$extended .= highlight_string("<" . "?php
    use Zend\Db\Sql\Sql;
    use Zend\Db\Sql\Ddl;

    \$t = new Ddl\CreateTable();
    \$t->setTable('bar');
    \$t->addColumn(new Ddl\Column\Integer(
        'id', 
        12, 
        true, 
        null,
        ['auto_increment' => true, 'comment' => 'Some comment']
    ));
    \$t->addColumn(new Ddl\Column\Varchar('name', 255));
    \$t->addColumn(new Ddl\Column\Char('foo', 20));
    \$t->addConstraint(new Ddl\Constraint\PrimaryKey('id'));
    \$t->addConstraint(new Ddl\Constraint\UniqueKey(
        ['name', 'foo'],
        'my_unique_key'
    ));

    \$sql = new Sql(\$adapter);
    echo \$sql->getSqlStringForSqlObject(\$t);
", true);
$extended .=<<<'EOC'
</pre>

<p>Once this table is created, it can then be altered:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
EOC;
$extended .= highlight_string("<" . "?php
    \$t = new Ddl\AlterTable('bar');
    \$t->changeColumn('name', new Ddl\Column\Varchar('new_name', 50));
    \$t->addColumn(new Ddl\Column\Varchar('another', 255));
    \$t->addColumn(new Ddl\Column\Varchar('other_id', 255));
    \$t->dropColumn('foo');
    \$t->addConstraint(new Ddl\Constraint\ForeignKey(
        'my_fk', 'other_id', 'other_table', 'id', 'CASCADE', 'CASCADE'
    ));
    \$t->dropConstraint('my_index');
    echo \$sql->getSqlStringForSqlObject(\$t);
", true);
$extended .=<<<'EOC'
</pre>

<p>Or even dropped:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
EOC;
$extended .= highlight_string("<" . "?php
    \$dt = new Ddl\DropTable('bar');
    echo \$sql->getSqlStringForSqlObject(\$dt);
", true);
$extended .=<<<'EOC'
</pre>

<p>
    What can this be used for?
</p>

<p>
    That is where you come in.  This particular feature was asked for numerous 
    times during ZF1 development.  We'd like to see what kind of ZF2 modules 
    can be created with this base infrastructure.  Migration assistant?  ORM 
    database creation tool?  Advanced CMS?  Let us know; we'll be adding more 
    vendor specific support over the 2.2 to 2.3 timeline.
</p>

<h2>New Service Wrappers</h2>

<p>
    Zend Framework has a long history of providing API wrappers; in fact, they
    were a prominent part of the initial pre-release! The tradition continues
    in ZF2, though each API wrapper now has its own repository.
</p>

<p>
    Alongside the 2.2.0 release, we're also providing initial beta releases of
    two new service components: <code>ZendService_Api</code> and 
    <code>ZendService_OpenStack</code>.
</p>

<h3>ZendService_Api</h3>

<p>
    This is an HTTP microframework for consuming generic API calls in PHP. This 
    framework can be used to create PHP libraries that consume specific HTTP APIs 
    using either a simple configuration array or files. This project uses the 
    <code>Zend\Http\Client</code> component of Zend Framework 2.
    <a href="http://www.zimuel.it/en/zendservice-api-micro-http-framework/">Enrico has 
blogged about the component previously.</a>
</p>

<h3>ZendService_OpenStack</h3>

<p>
    We began the development of a new library to support the last API version of <a 
    href="http://www.openstack.org">OpenStack</a>.
    The goal of this component is to simplify the usage of OpenStack in PHP, 
    providing a simple object oriented interface to its API services.
    This component is based on <code>ZendService_Api</code>, giving us a flexible 
    way to update the HTTP specification with the future API versions.
</p>

<h2>ZFTool Diagnostic Features</h2>

<p>
    Artur Bodera (aka Thinkscape) provided a new diagnostics feature for ZFTool. 
    Using this feature, we can allow the execution of customized diagnostics tests 
    in ZF2 projects, including testing for the required PHP version, testing for 
    specific PHP extensions, testing for specific ZF2 modules, testing for specific 
    PHP INI settings, and more; <a 
    href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZFTool/blob/master/docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md">read 
    the documentation to get an idea of the variety of tests available.</a>
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, with the collaboration of the <a 
    href="https://github.com/liip/LiipMonitor">LiipMonitor project</a>, we decided 
    to create common interfaces for performing diagnostic tests in PHP 
    applications.  An initial draft is available in the <a 
    href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendDiagnostics">ZendDiagnostic 
    repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The diagnostics feature is available in the <a href="https://packages.zendframework.com/zftool.phar">
    latest version of ZFTool</a>.
</p>

<h2>Hydrator Improvements</h2>

<p>
    As noted earlier, <code>Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator</code> now has a plugin manager
    you can compose into your objects for managing hydrator instances. However,
    beyond that, we also now have an "Aggregate Hydrator", which allows you to
    provide specialized mapping of your object types to hydrators via an event-based
    system.
</p>

<p>
    Why is this exciting? Many of our users utilize <a href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a>
    as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) system. Oftentimes, the entities that you
    work with will also form a hierarchical structure. The Aggregate Hydrator allows
    allows you to attach a single hydrator to the parent object, and ensure that all
    child and descendant objects are either hydrated or extracted according to their
    type.
</p>

<h2>Reducing Dependencies</h2>

<p>
    We have started work on a new story for the framework: reducing dependencies
    for individual components. We have received feedback from a number of 
    developers and organizations indicating that even though each component
    can be installed individually, the number of dependencies most components
    mark as required leads to a situation where they feel they must choose
    whether or not they adopt the framework, versus adopting just the component.
    While of course we'd like them to adopt the framework, we'd rather they
    get a taste for it, if you will.
</p>

<p>
    While this story is primarily slated for 2.3, we have made our first steps
    in 2.2, with the <code>Zend\Feed</code> and <code>Zend\Validator</code>
    components. 
</p>

<p>
    <code>Zend\Validator</code> removed its dependency on the i18n component.
    We achieved this by creating <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/separatedInterface.html" target="_blank">Separated 
    Interfaces</a> for the translator. Considering translation was only enabled
    if you explicitly injected a translator, this was a natural course of action.
    (It also introduced a minor backwards compatibility break; see below for more
    information.)
</p>

<p>
    For <code>Zend\Feed</code>, many "required" dependencies were actually
    optional already, and we could mark them as such. There were two that were
    not, however, and which required similar treatment as <code>Zend\Validator</code>
    in creating separated interfaces: the service manager (used for extension
    management) and HTTP (for fetching remote feeds with the reader). Interfaces
    were developed for each of these, and <code>Zend\Feed</code> now has only
    two required dependencies. A nice side benefit is that you can now use
    third-party HTTP clients with <code>Zend\Feed\Reader</code>!
</p>

<h2>Migration Notes</h2>

<p>
    While we have worked hard to keep code backwards compatible (BC), there are a few
    noteworth changes that <em>may</em> affect your code.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Zend\Validator</code> no longer directly consumes a <code>Zend\I18n\Translator\Translator</code> 
        instance; instead, you must either implement <code>Zend\Validator\Translator\TranslatorInterface</code>
        or use <code>Zend\Mvc\I18n\Translator</code>. In most cases, this change
        should be transparent, as validator instances managed by the 
        ValidatorPluginManager will already be using the correct instance.
    </li>

    <li>In 2.1.5, a BC break was accidently introduced into <code>Zend\Navigation</code> in
        order to enable a feature: MVC pages were altered to always use route match values when
        available when generating URIs. 2.2.0 was modified to add a flag to enable this
        behavior on demand, but defaults to the original behavior, which does not
        pass the route match values to the pages. If you relied on this behavior
        in 2.1.5, add the following option to your individual MVC page definitions:

        <pre class="highlight">
EOC;
$extended .= highlight_string("<" . "?php
'use_route_match' => true,
", true);
$extended .=<<<'EOC'
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

        a service with a decorator; "lazy" factories, allowing the ability to 
        delay factory creation invocation until the moment of first use.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Stdlib:</strong> Addition of a HydratorAwareInterface; creation 
        of a HydratorPluginManager.

        helpers; deprecation of the Placeholder Registry and removal of it from 
        the implemented placeholder system; new explicit factory classes for helpers
        that have collaborators (making them easier to override/replace).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
    Greater than 150 patches were applied for 2.2.0. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/changelog/2.2.0">http://framework.zend.com/changelog/2.2.0</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Announcements</h2>

<p>
    Over a month ago, we migrated <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf1">Zend 
    Framework 1 to GitHub</a>. At that time, we also migrated active issues created since
    1.12.0 to the <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>,
    and marked our self-hosted issue tracker read-only. We have decided to turn off that issue
    tracker, but still retain the original issues at their original locations for purposes
    of history and transparency. You can find information on the change on our <a href="/issues">
    issues landing page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    Please join me in thanking everyone who provided new features and code 
    improvements for the 2.2.0 release! We had a huge leap forward in usability
    of many components, and a number of key new features that make developing
    applications simpler. We'll be continuing on these themes for the next
    release as well.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    Maintenance releases are scheduled for the third Wednesday of each month;
    expect 2.2.1 on 19 June 2013. Minor releases are scheduled roughly every 
    quarter; look for 2.3 sometime around mid-August or early September. 
    Proposals and ideas for stories will be presented on the zf-contributors
    mailing list; subscribe by sending an email to 
    zf-contributors-subscribe [at] lists.zend.com if you are interested in
    assisting with its development.
