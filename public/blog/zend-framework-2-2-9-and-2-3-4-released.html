<p>
    One new security advisory has been made:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/security/advisory/ZF2015-01">ZF2015-01</a>, which patches
        <kbd>Zend\Session</kbd>'s handling of session validators to ensure
        that any metadata they store in the session for validation of subsequent
        requests is properly persisted.
    </li>

<p>
    For more information, follow the links above; if you use <kbd>Zend\Session</kbd>

    <a href="https://github.com/ocramius">Marco Pivetta</a> in particular, for the tireless
    effort he has made in triaging and merging pull requests for the 2.3.4 release; his
    efforts have been invaluable.
