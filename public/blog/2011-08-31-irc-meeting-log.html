<h2>2011-08-31 IRC Meeting Log</h2>
<p>
    Today we held our second Zend Framework community IRC meeting. Find out what
    we discussed, and where you can read the transcript.
</p><p>
    The meeting 
    was held on Freenode IRC in the #zf2-meeting channel, and moderated by 
    Pieter Kokx. The meeting ran long (15 minutes over), had several heated 
    exchanges, but gained general consensus on a variety of topics.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, we discussed:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>Modules - defining what "module" means, and differentiating it from 
        "component", as well as defining these terms in relation to "library" 
        and "application".
    </li>
    <li>Distribution categories - what broad categories we'll define as "buckets"
        for components, and which categories will be considered necessary for the 
        "standard distribution" -- which defines what needs to be done to be 
        considered stable.
    </li>
    <li>Timeframes for potential releases.</li>
</ul>

<p>
