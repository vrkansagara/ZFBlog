<h2>Apigility 1.0.2 Released!</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apigility 1.0.2!</p>

</ul>

<p>This is our second maintenance release of Apigility, fixing a number of issues, and providing significant improvements for file upload capabilities.</p><h2>Upload Support</h2>

<p>Uploads were possible before this release, but were difficult to properly enable. Additionally, PATCH and PUT requests required manually handling the file uploads, as PHP does not natively support file uploads for those request methods; the Zend Framework 2 InputFilter component, because it utilizes PHP's native support for validating that an upload completed and for moving an upload file to a new location, also could not deal with these methods.</p>

<p>This release makes the following changes in order to facilitate file uploads via your Apigility API:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Content validation was altered to merge file upload data, when present, with  the submitted API fields. </li>
    <li>The Admin UI now allows you to mark a field as representing a file upload;  this ensures that content validation will work properly, as content validation  differs for file uploads. </li>
    <li>The content negotiation module now provides emulation for PHP's file upload  support when receiving PATCH and PUT requests, ensuring that the files are  uploaded in the same manner, cleaned up post-request, and passed to validation  properly. You should notice no difference between POST, PUT, or PATCH requests  when performing file uploads, whether a single or multiple files are provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>File uploads are only done using the <code>multipart/form-data</code> media type. You will need to add that media type to the content negotiation whitelist if you plan to perform file uploads.</p>

<p>If you have further questions, you can <a href="https://apigility.org/documentation/recipes/upload-files-to-api">consult the documentation</a>.</p>
