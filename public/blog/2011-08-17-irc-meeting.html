<h2>2011-08-17 IRC Meeting</h2>
<p>
    The Zend Framework community is having the first of its bi-weekly IRC 
    meetings this coming Wednesday, 17 August 2011, at 17:00 UTC. Find out what 
    we'll discuss, and how you can participate.
</p><p>
    The meeting will be held on Freenode IRC, in a new channel "#zf2-meeting". 
    As this is the first meeting, we'll be primarily discussing the structure
    of future meetings, as well as process and milestones for ZF2.

<p>
    Those with the rights to edit pages in the wiki can add to the agenda; be 
    warned, however, that the idea is to keep the topics timeboxed to ensure
    that the essentials are covered, decisions are made, and actionable items
    discovered and assigned.
</p>

<p>
    Following the meeting, we will post the transcript, and link to it via this
    blog, along with a summary.
