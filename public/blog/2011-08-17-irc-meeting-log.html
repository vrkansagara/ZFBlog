<h2>2011-08-17 IRC Meeting Log</h2>
<p>
    Today we held the first Zend Framework community IRC meeting. Find out what
    we discussed, and where you can read the transcript.
</p><p>
    The meeting 
    was held on Freenode IRC in the #zf2-meeting channel, and moderated by 
    Pieter Kokx. While sometimes boisterous, sometimes off-topic, it definitely
    helped build some community spirit as well as consensus surrounding the 
    direction of ZF2.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, we discussed:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>Format of meetings and how agendas will be created.</li>
    <li>The proposal process.</li>
    <li>Milestones towards ZF2's completion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The full transcript, as well as a summary of decisions, can be found on the
