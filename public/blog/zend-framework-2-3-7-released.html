    of:
</p>

        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul><h2>Fixes</h2>

<p>
    Zend Framework 2.3.6 released a change against <kbd>Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController</kbd>
    that was originally intended for the upcoming 2.4.0 release, and which introduces a slight
    backwards compatibility (BC) break. 2.3.7 reverts the change to keep BC in the 2.3 series.
</p>

<h2>Support Zend Framework!</h2>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<p>
    We are currently actively finishing the final features for Zend Framework 2.4, and plan a release
    candidate for next week (week of 17 March 2015). Once 2.4 stable is released, we turn towards
    Zend Framework 3 tasks, as outlined in <a href="/blog/announcing-the-zend-framework-3-roadmap.html">
