<h2>Zend Framework 2.5.1 Released!</h2>
<p>Today we've released Zend Framework 2.5.1!</p>

<p>
    To update, use <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>:
</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$ composer update zendframework/zendframework
</code></pre><h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
    The only issue reported against 2.5.0 was a blocker for many: with the shift
    to ZF becoming a metapackage, one component, <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zend-ldap">zend-ldap</a>,
    had a hard requirement on a specific PHP extension (ext/ldap), meaning that 
    the extension then became a requirement for the entire framework.
</p>

<p>
    ZF 2.5.1 addresses this by making zend/ldap a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#suggest">
    suggested</a> component. <em>This means that the zend-ldap component is no longer installed
    by default.</em> If you rely on zend-ldap for your application, you will need to
    perform the following after upgrading to 2.5.1:
</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$ composer require zendframework/zend-ldap
</code></pre>

<p>
    The above will add zend-ldap as a requirement to your project, ensuring it
    is present going forward.
</p>

<p>
    We also audited all other components for hard dependencies on extensions; no
    other components did so.
