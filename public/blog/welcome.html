<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the new Zend Framework development blog!
</p><p>
    This blog is a new effort by the Zend Framework team to keep the ZF 
    community abreast of development as we work towards version 2.0 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
    In the coming days and weeks, we will be posting updates, including:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>
        Weekly status of Zend's ZF team as they work on ZF2.
    </li>

    <li>
        Links to new MVC (and other) prototypes for developers to examine, test,
        and ultimately provide feedback on.
    </li>

    <li>
        Announcements of new developer snapshot releases.
    </li>

    <li>
        Documentation and examples for newly written or refactored components.
    </li>

    <li>
        Links and summaries of blog posts covering ZF2 development and usage.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Most communication is currently taking place on the <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/ZF-Contributor-f680267.html">zf-contributors 
    mailing list</a>, and we encourage you to subscribe to that list in order
