<h2>Zend Framework 2.0.2 Released!</h2>
<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.0.2! Packages and installation instructions are

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This release fixes an issue in the "Router" service that was affecting URL generation,
    among other things.
</p><p>
    Specifically, for the 2.0.1 release, a change was made to allow URL generation
    to continue to work even under a Console paradigm. However, this change apparently
    caused URL generation to break in a number of situations when in an HTTP paradigm.
    A fix was put into place, and integration tests created, to ensure this works
    going forward.
</p>
